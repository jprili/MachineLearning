## Machine Learning Study ##

The purpose of this project is to study machine learning  
by hands on work. This will involve the creation of a neural network  
without importing python libraries for machine learning. 

This project is inspired by:

- Samson Zhang's [video on neural network construction,](https://youtu.be/w8yWXqWQYmU)  
- 3b1b - [Neural Networks](https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/neural-networks)  
-
